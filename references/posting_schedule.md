## Platform-Specific Notes

### TikTok
- Algorithm favors consistency over timing
- First 30 min after posting is critical for initial engagement
- Use trending sounds within first 48 hours of them blowing up
- Post at least 3x/week minimum to stay in the algorithm

### Instagram Reels
- Shares and saves weigh more than likes
- Cross-post TikTok content but remove watermark
- Use 3-5 hashtags (less is more since 2024 algorithm update)
- Stories can promote your Reel for extra reach

### YouTube Shorts
- Longer shelf life than TikTok/IG (evergreen discovery)
- Strong titles matter more here (search-driven)
- Can repurpose TikTok content directly
- Subscribe CTA in first comment works well
